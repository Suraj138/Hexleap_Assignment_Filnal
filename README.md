# Hexleap Frontend Internship Assignment

Welcome to the Hexleap Frontend Internship Assignment project! This repository contains the code for the assignment that demonstrates your skills in developing frontend components using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript.

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop two small components of the Hexleap project in both light and dark modes, as per the provided designs in Figma. The components should be modular, reusable, and responsive for mobile devices down to a width of 320px.

## Technologies Used

- Next.js: React framework for building server-side rendered applications.
- Tailwind CSS: Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- TypeScript: Typed superset of JavaScript for enhanced developer productivity and code quality.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
